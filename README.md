Project: Bharatnatyam Pose Classification

This project focuses on classifying Bharatnatyam dance poses using Machine Learning techniques.
We collected pose data, preprocessed it, and trained classification models to recognize different postures.

ðŸ”¹ Current Status

Successfully implemented basic pose detection & classification pipeline.

Models are able to classify poses, but accuracy is not yet optimal.

Dataset size, pose variations, and model tuning need further work.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Expanding the dataset with more diverse and accurate pose samples.

Applying advanced deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, transfer learning with pose estimation frameworks).

Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.

Incorporating real-time detection using OpenCV or MediaPipe.
